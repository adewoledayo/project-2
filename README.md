# ESG Concerns- A Data Mining excercise on Opportunities and Challenges of the Sharing Economy: Airbnb. A focus on Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom.
* Emergence of peer-to-peer systems and platforms, collectively known as the "sharing economy", has allowed individuals to collaboratively make use of under-utilized assets via fee-based sharing. Airbnb is one of the pioneers of this sharing economy and has had a significant impact on the tourism and hospitality industry as well as on destination economies, the experience of a place by a guest.
* A Data mining/analysis exercise of Airbnb listings is provided to reveal meaningful patterns, clusters and build a classification model that would differentiate hosts and/or listings that provide temporary accommodation or illegal accommodations that are more permanent thereby posing a social menace.
* I have used Python and SAS as my programming language for Machine Learning modeling drawing the inferences I have stated and models created.
* I have built a working model using the Logistic Regression model which can be used for any out-of-dataset observation. The characteristics noted on the Clusters will be used to ascertain on such listing to verify if the attributes portray a “temporary accommodation” which is legal or an “illegal short-term rental” which is a more permanent house letting and creates a social concern for the community, environment and globally.
